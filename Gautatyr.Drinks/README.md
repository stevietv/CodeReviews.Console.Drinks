# DrinksInfos
Console application allowing the user to retrieve the recipe and other details about drinks.
Developed using C#/.NET, consuming [The cocktail database API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).

# Features
## The cocktail database API
- Drinks classed by categories.
- Retrieve ingredients and quantities as well as the recipe for each drinks.

## Console Based UI
- Clean table representation made posible thanks to [ConsoleTableExt](https://github.com/minhhungit/ConsoleTableExt).

# Challenges
- Learning to consume retrieve and API and to use the JSON response to make something of it was not so easy at the begining, but it
is very interesting to be able to exploit data from outside the application.
